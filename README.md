### Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Kevin Kho. I am currently working on [Fugue](https://github.com/fugue-project/fugue/), a minimal interface to bring Python, Pandas, and SQL code to Spark, Dask, and Ray. Most recently, I was at [Prefect](https://github.com/PrefectHQ/prefect) as an Open Source Community Engineer where I managed the Slack community and created content. Before working on open-source tooling, I was a data scientist for four years across [Paylocity](https://www.paylocity.com/) and [Itron](https://www.itron.com/). 

I am contracting part time with a Fortune 50 company helping them scale compute workflows to distributed computing.

**Contact me!**

Feel free to reach out to me for anything data related. I talk to people about big data, data artichecture, data engineering, and data careers. Always happy to speak at Meetups, Lunch and Learn, or internal company meetings about the things I'm working on.
